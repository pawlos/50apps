Here goes this week's problem statement.

Simple Part:
- create a simple Snakes game using HTML5
- the game starts when the user presses the space bar. A snake (string
of attached squares) keeps moving in a big enough rectangular region
in straight direction
- using the arrow keys the user can change the direction of the snake,
left or right
- the challenge for the user is to not touch the boundary of the
rectangular region
- if the user touches the rectangle, the game ends
- to know what a snake game is, please refer to http://www.snakegame.net/neavesnake.htm
- add music at the background and sound effects when the snake touches
the rectangular region

Complex part: (Optional. if you complete simple part and want to take
up something more challenging)
- place food (single squares) randomly in the rectangular region
- if the snake passes through the food, add one square extra to the
lenght of the snake
